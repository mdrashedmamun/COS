# Business Teardown Transcripts

This directory contains 8 raw business teardown sessions showing the consulting methodology applied in real-time. These are verbatim RTF transcripts from video sessions where businesses are analyzed from concept to $1M-$5M+ revenue projections.

## What These Transcripts Are

These are **not** polished case studies or cleaned-up presentations. Instead, they are:

- **Raw consulting sessions**: Live business teardowns showing real-time decision-making
- **Verbatim transcripts**: Exact quotes with timestamps from the original video
- **Methodology in action**: Shows how the 5-phase consulting process unfolds
- **Decision trees**: Real conditional logic applied to actual business data
- **Reference material**: Timestamps allow verification and cross-referencing with playbooks

## How Transcripts Relate to Playbooks

Each playbook is **derived from** one or more of these transcripts:

| Playbook | Transcript | Duration | Business Model |

| 01_garbage_collection | 01_Building_$1M_69mins | 69 minutes | Recurring service (trash collection) |

## How to Extract Information from Transcripts

### 1. **Get Verbatim Quotes**
- Identify exact timestamps where key business data is stated
- Extract exact quote from transcript
- Format as: "Quote here" [MM:SS]
- Verify by checking video/transcript at that timestamp

### 2. **Build Required Inputs**
Look for statements that tell you:
- Total revenue (annual or monthly)
- Profit or loss amount
- Net margin percentage
- Customer count or customer types
- CAC (marketing spend / customers)
- LTV (customer lifetime value)
- Lead sources and channels
- Conversion rates (leads → sales)
- Pricing model
- Fulfillment capacity

### 3. **Identify Constraints**
Listen for:
- What the business owner says is the problem
- What metrics reveal is actually the constraint
- Decision rules applied by the consultant
- Which constraint gets addressed first

### 4. **Follow the Decision Tree**
- Note timestamps where each decision is made
- Write the decision rule ("If X, then Y")
- Track what evidence supports each decision
- See how recommendations change as new data emerges

### 5. **Extract Frameworks**
- Watch for references to the 3 Alex Hormozi books
- Note page numbers when mentioned
- See how frameworks map to the business
- Observe which framework unlocks the solution

## Using Transcripts as Reference

### For Playbook Development
- If creating a new playbook, start with a transcript
- Extract the Business Snapshot from verbatim quotes
- Build the Step-by-Step Teardown following the consultant's logic
- Reference timestamps so other practitioners can verify

### For Methodology Learning
- Watch/read the entire transcript once for flow
- Rewatch key sections (noted above) focusing on decision points
- Extract decision rules and test them on other businesses
- Note which frameworks (100M Offers, 100M Leads, Money Models) apply

### For Decision Rule Library
- Each transcript demonstrates 3-5 key decision rules
- Compare rules across transcripts to identify universal patterns
- Document the exact timestamp where each rule is applied
- Create conditional statements for similar business scenarios

## Timestamp Format

All timestamps are in **MM:SS** format (minutes:seconds) from the start of the video/transcript.

Example:
- `[0:18]` = 18 seconds into the recording
- `[5:45]` = 5 minutes, 45 seconds
- `[42:33]` = 42 minutes, 33 seconds

This format allows anyone to find the exact location in the source video to verify methodology.

## Cross-References

- **Decision rules extracted**: ../../docs/consulting/decision-rules.md
- **Metrics definitions**: ../../docs/consulting/metrics-glossary.md
- **Creating playbooks from transcripts**: ../../docs/consulting/playbook-template.md

## Notes on Transcript Quality

- **Timestamps**: Correspond to original video recordings
- **Completeness**: All transcripts are verbatim (word-for-word)
- **Accuracy**: Verified against source videos where possible

## For Future Development

- Transcripts 04, 06, and 08 are candidates for new playbook development
- Additional transcripts may be added as new consulting sessions are recorded
- Each new transcript should follow the same verbatim + timestamp format
- New playbooks should be created following the playbook-template.md structure
