## When to Use Each Playbook

### Garbage Collection (01)
**Use this if your business:**
- Has negative margins or negative net profit
- Operates in a recurring revenue model
- Has multiple customer segments with different acquisition costs
- Needs to choose between two avatars

**Key lesson:** Fix one avatar and one channel to profitability BEFORE scaling. Scale a working model, not a broken one.

**Best for:** Businesses that are currently losing money or barely breaking even

---

### Personal Styling (02)
**Use this if your business:**
- Has high-touch service delivery (artist/expert dependent)
- Is profitable but has slow growth
- Relies on lead generation (ads, word-of-mouth)
- Needs to improve lead-to-customer conversion

**Key lesson:** Even with healthy overall margins, improving lead magnet and funnel conversion unlocks scaling.

**Best for:** Consultant, coach, designer, or specialist service business

---

### Chiropractic Chain (03)
**Use this if your business:**
- Has multiple locations or franchises
- Shows healthy unit economics but limited growth
- Has multiple lead channels with different performance
- Needs to prioritize which channels to scale

**Key lesson:** When core model works, expand systematically into underexploited channels (Google, local SEO, partnerships).

**Best for:** Multi-location or franchise business looking to expand

---

### Beverage Consulting (05)
**Use this if your business:**
- Is a high-ticket B2B consulting or services business
- Has unstable lead flow ("feast or famine")
- Has low offer-market fit or high CAC
- Needs to rebuild the positioning/messaging

**Key lesson:** Lead drought often signals offer-market mismatch, not a lead channel problem. Fix the offer first.

**Best for:** High-ticket services or consulting with inconsistent sales

---

### Music Legal Services (06)
**Use this if your business:**
- Has multiple revenue streams (products, services, education, SaaS)
- Is losing money overall despite some profitable units
- Spreads effort across too many channels
- Needs to choose what to kill vs what to double down on

**Key lesson:** When diluted across too many offerings, focus on the profitable core and kill the rest. Remove noise.

**Best for:** Multi-product businesses that need to consolidate focus

---

### Eyelash Salon Chain (07)
**Use this if your business:**
- Is a multi-location recurring revenue business
- Has good margins but struggles with consistency
- Has training/quality control issues
- Combines lead generation problems with operational scaling

**Key lesson:** Growth requires both customer acquisition (lead gen) AND operational consistency (manager training, systems).

**Best for:** Franchise, chain, or multi-location recurring service

---

### Thai Restaurant (08)
**Use this if your business:**
- Is a food service or restaurant business
- Has existing customer flow but lower-than-possible revenue per customer
- Uses discounting as main promotion strategy
- Has peak vs off-peak utilization problems

**Key lesson:** Pricing strategy (premium pricing during peak, bundled value during off-peak) beats percentage discounting.

**Best for:** Restaurant, cafe, or location-based service business

---

## Reading Order Recommendations

### "I've never seen this methodology before"
1. **Start with: Garbage Collection (01)**
   - Clearest example of the 11-section structure
   - Covers the most fundamental decision: one avatar, one channel
   - Shows negative margin fix (most common scenario)

2. **Then read: Personal Styling (02)**
   - Shows profitable business improving further
   - Illustrates lead funnel optimization
   - Smaller/simpler than other playbooks

3. **Then study: Any other playbook**
   - Same structure, different constraints
   - Compare decision rules across models

### "My business is similar to one of these"
- Find the matching playbook in the table above
- Read that one first as your primary reference
- Then read 1-2 adjacent playbooks for additional frameworks

### "I'm building internal processes"
- Read all 7 playbooks in this order: 01 → 02 → 03 → 05 → 06 → 07 → 08
- Extract decision rules that appear in multiple playbooks (these are universal)
- Create internal templates based on the 11-section structure

## Playbook Structure Overview

Every playbook contains these 11 sections in order:

1. **Title and metadata** - Business model + data source
2. **How to Use This** - Instructions for reproducibility
3. **Business Snapshot** - Verbatim quotes with timestamps
4. **Required Inputs** - Minimum data needed
5. **Derived Metrics** - Calculated from business data
6. **Step-by-Step Teardown** - 6-10 numbered decision steps
7. **Book Frameworks Applied** - Which of the 3 Alex Hormozi books apply
8. **Example Outputs** - What a Growth Physics Brief looks like
9. **Book Anchors** - Direct quotes from reference books
10. **Simulation Checklist** - Reproducible action items
11. **Assumptions Log** - Template for deviations from data

## Key Metrics Explained

All playbooks use the same metrics. Key ones to compare:

### LTV:CAC Ratio
- **Garbage Collection**: 18:1 (HOA segment) - excellent
- **Personal Styling**: 16:1 - excellent
- **Chiropractic**: 4.8:1 - healthy but room to improve
- **Beverage**: 1.7:1 - poor; fix before scaling
- **Restaurant**: Not explicitly stated; appears healthy

**Interpretation**: Higher ratio = healthier unit economics. Target ≥3:1 to scale safely.

### Net Margin
- **Garbage Collection**: -23% (LOSING money)
- **Personal Styling**: +42% (VERY healthy)
- **Chiropractic**: +23% (healthy)
- **Beverage**: +11.3% (healthy)
- **Music Legal**: -33% (LOSING money)
- **Eyelash**: +28% (healthy)
- **Restaurant**: +19% (healthy)

**Interpretation**: Negative margins indicate the model is broken. Must fix before scaling.

## Common Decision Rules Across All Playbooks

These patterns repeat across multiple playbooks:

1. **If net margin is negative → Fix unit economics before scaling**
   - Seen in: Garbage Collection (01), Music Legal (06)

2. **If one avatar/channel outperforms others 3x+ → Kill the rest and scale the winner**
   - Seen in: Garbage Collection (01), Chiropractic (03)

3. **If LTV:CAC < 3:1 → Don't scale acquisition yet**
   - Seen in: Beverage (05), Chiropractic (03)

4. **If close rates > 40% → Test higher pricing**
   - Seen in: Personal Styling (02), Garbage Collection (01)

5. **If multiple revenue streams but one is profitable → Kill the rest**
   - Seen in: Music Legal (06)

6. **If offer conversion is low → Problem is offer-market fit, not lead volume**
   - Seen in: Beverage (05), Personal Styling (02)

## Book Frameworks Used

All playbooks integrate three reference books:

### 100M Offers (Value Equation Framework)
**Applied in**: All playbooks (01-08)
- Mapping current offer to Value Equation
- Testing offer variations to improve conversion
- Rebuilding offers for clarity and appeal

### 100M Leads (Lead Generation Framework)
**Applied in**: All playbooks (01-08)
- Choosing lead channels based on avatar
- Testing different lead magnets
- Improving funnel top-of-funnel conversion

### Money Models (Business Model Patterns)
**Applied in**: All playbooks (01-08)
- Recognizing recurring vs one-time revenue
- Converting one-time to recurring when possible
- Retention/churn impact on LTV

## How to Create Your Own Playbook

Follow this process:

1. **Get a business transcript** with verbatim quotes and timestamps (audio, video, or interview)
2. **Extract the Business Snapshot** - Pull exact quotes that reveal key constraints
3. **Collect Required Inputs** - Ask for minimum financial data: revenue, CAC, LTV, margins, channels
4. **Calculate Derived Metrics** - Use formulas from the metrics glossary
5. **Build Step-by-Step Teardown** - Follow the pattern from any existing playbook
6. **Apply Book Frameworks** - Map offer to Value Equation, channels to Lead Generation, model to Money Models
7. **Write Decision Rules** - Document the conditional logic for each step
8. **Validate with Evidence** - Every recommendation must trace back to quotes or metrics
9. **Create Simulation Checklist** - List the actions someone would take to replicate your analysis

Template: See **docs/consulting/playbook-template.md**

## Data Extraction Guide

When reading a playbook, pay attention to these sections:

### Business Snapshot
- Read the verbatim quotes carefully
- Note the timestamps (these reference the video/transcript)
- Look for contradictions (what does the owner think is the problem vs. what metrics show?)

### Derived Metrics
- Check the math (CAC, LTV, margins)
- LTV:CAC ratio tells you if business is scalable
- Net margin tells you if business is profitable
- Conversion rates show offer-market fit

### Step-by-Step Teardown
- Each step has a Goal, Evidence, Decision Rule, and Output
- Decision rules are the KEY - they're conditional logic applicable to similar businesses
- Follow the steps in order; they build on each other

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Which playbook should I read first?**
A: Start with Garbage Collection (01) if you've never seen this framework. It's the clearest example of the 11-section structure and shows the most fundamental decision (one avatar, one channel).

**Q: Can I apply multiple playbooks to my business?**
A: Yes. If your business is a multi-location chain, read both Chiropractic (03) and Eyelash (07). Extract decision rules that apply across both models.

**Q: What if my business doesn't match any playbook?**
A: Use the playbook-template.md to create a new one. The methodology is designed to work for any service business.

**Q: Are the decision rules in one playbook applicable to my business?**
A: Often yes, if your business has similar constraints. Example: The "one avatar, one channel" rule from Garbage Collection (01) applies to most businesses starting with negative margins.

**Q: How do I use a playbook to improve my existing business?**
A: 1) Read the entire playbook. 2) Map your business to the 11 sections. 3) Extract your derived metrics. 4) Follow the Step-by-Step Teardown. 5) Apply decision rules to your data. 6) Document assumptions.

**Q: Can I use playbook outputs without having verbatim data?**
A: Yes, but label it as "scenario" in your Assumptions Log. The closer you stick to actual verbatim data, the more reliable the output.
