# Growth Physics Skill - Service Business Analysis Framework

**A practical framework for diagnosing growth bottlenecks in service businesses using real case studies and proven formulas.**

---

## 📊 Skill Overview

The Growth Physics skill provides actionable analysis for service businesses by:

3. **Providing playbooks** - Step-by-step strategies from proven case studies
4. **Quantifying impact** - Using Growth Physics formulas for decisions

---

## 🎯 Core Concepts

### Growth Physics Framework

Every service business has ONE primary constraint that limits growth:

1. **DEMAND** - Not enough leads or customer interest
   - Symptoms: High close rate, low lead volume
   - Solution: Improve marketing and lead generation
   - Example: AC Styles (lead magnet optimization)

2. **DELIVERY** - Limited capacity to serve customers
   - Symptoms: High demand, team at capacity
   - Solution: Systematize and scale team
   - Example: Amy Lash and Beauty (technician scaling)

3. **EFFICIENCY** - Unit economics don't work
   - Symptoms: Margins declining as you scale
   - Solution: Reduce costs or improve pricing
   - Example: Garvey Disposal (route optimization)

4. **QUALITY** - Consistency issues limit retention
   - Symptoms: Good sales, high churn
   - Solution: Build systems and standards
   - Example: Multi-location operations

5. **CAPITAL** - Needs investment to scale
   - Symptoms: Can't grow without significant capex
   - Solution: Secure funding or adjust model
   - Example: Waste management (truck fleet)

6. **RETENTION** - High churn limits LTV
   - Symptoms: Good acquisition, but customers leave
   - Solution: Improve product/service quality
   - Example: Professional services (client retention)

7. **PRICING** - Commoditization pressure
   - Symptoms: Price competition, race to bottom
   - Solution: Differentiate or target segments
   - Example: Waste management vs. HOA specialization

### Key Formulas

**Unit Economics Foundation**
```
LTV:CAC Ratio = Customer Lifetime Value / Customer Acquisition Cost
Healthy Ratio: ≥ 3:1 (target 5:1+)
```

**Churn Impact on LTV**
```
True LTV = Monthly Profit / Monthly Churn Rate
5% reduction in churn = 2x increase in LTV
```

**Revenue Per Customer**
```
LTV = (Gross Margin Per Customer) / (Churn Rate)
= (Revenue Per Customer - Cost Per Customer) / Churn Rate
```

**Capacity-Based Scaling**
```
Revenue = Customers × Transaction Frequency × Average Ticket Value
Revenue = Capacity Utilization × Throughput × Price
```
