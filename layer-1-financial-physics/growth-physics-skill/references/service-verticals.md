- Waste Management (Scatter + HOA), Hybrid Retail (B2C + B2B), Restaurant (dine-in + catering)
- Strategy: Focus on highest-value avatar first, then scale other segments

### Pattern 4: Recurring Revenue Transforms Unit Economics
- Personal Styling: $8.5K onboarding opens door to $2-4.5K monthly
- Beauty Services: Individual fills drive 3-4 week appointment cycle
- Professional Services: Monthly retainers replace hourly billable
