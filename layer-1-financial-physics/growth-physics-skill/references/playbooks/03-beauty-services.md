# Beauty Services - Growth Physics Playbook

**Case Study:** Amy Lash and Beauty
**Revenue:** $2.3M | **Net Margin:** 28% | **Model:** Multi-location eyelash extensions + beauty

---

## Business Model

Eyelash extensions and beauty services chain with recurring appointment model:
- **Services:** Lash extensions, fills, removal, brow services, waxing
- **Pricing:** Initial set $150-200, fills $60-80 every 3-4 weeks, packages available
- **Revenue Model:** Recurring appointments (clients return every 3-4 weeks)
- **Structure:** Multiple locations (salon chain)

**Current State:** $2.3M revenue, 28% net margin, high gross margin (60%+)

## Growth Physics Analysis

### Primary Constraint
**Labor Scaling** - Not demand, not economics.

Beauty services are labor-intensive. Revenue is directly tied to technician capacity. Challenge: Finding, training, and retaining quality technicians.

### Secondary Constraint
**Quality Consistency** - Across multiple locations and technicians.

Lash extensions require skill and artistry. Poor quality = client churn. Multi-location model means standardization is critical.

## The Intervention (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Confirm Unit Economics
✓ **Status:** Healthy
- 28% net margin is excellent for service business
- Recurring revenue model (clients return every 3-4 weeks)
- High gross margin (60%+) means labor cost is well-covered
- **Decision:** Scale through labor, not pricing

### Step 2: Define Client Retention Strategy
**Goal:** Maximize LTV by reducing churn and increasing frequency

**Current State Analysis:**
- Assumption: 30-40 recurring clients per technician per location
- Client visit frequency: Every 3-4 weeks (12-17 visits/year)
- Annual LTV per client: $1,000-1,500 (conservative)

**Retention Levers:**
1. **Quality Consistency:** Every fill should be excellent (churn driver #1)
2. **Experience:** Comfortable environment, skilled technicians, personal touch
3. **Booking Automation:** Text/email reminders for refill appointments
4. **Loyalty Program:** 10th fill free or $50 off package
5. **Upsells:** Brow services, add-on lash styles, special occasion designs

### Step 3: Build Scalable Technician Training Program
**Challenge:** Each new location needs 5-8 trained technicians

**Solution: Standardized Training System**
1. **Certification Program** (4-6 week intensive)
   - Curriculum: Lash anatomy, application technique, safety, customer service
   - Hands-on practice on models (100+ applications)
   - Certification test (skill + knowledge)
   - Investment per technician: $2,000-3,000

2. **Quality Control System**
   - Monthly skill audits (review photos of client work)
   - Client satisfaction surveys (Net Promoter Score)
   - Mystery shopper visits (quarterly)
   - Feedback loops (retrain if quality drops)

3. **Retention Compensation**
   - Base salary + commission per appointment
   - Performance bonus (quality + client satisfaction)
   - Career path: Jr. Technician → Sr. Technician → Location Lead

### Step 4: Optimize Technician Utilization & Scheduling
**Goal:** Max billable hours without burnout (burnout = turnover)

**Current Challenge:**
- Lash extensions take 2-3 hours per client (initial set)
- Fills take 45 minutes to 1 hour
- Appointments often not back-to-back (gaps reduce utilization)

**Optimization Actions:**
1. **Appointment Scheduling:**
   - 80% of appointments should be fills (repeat clients), not initial sets
   - Schedule initial sets strategically (2-3 per technician per week max)
   - Back-to-back fills reduce travel/setup time

2. **Revenue per Technician Target:**
   - 5-6 clients per day × 5 days/week × 50 weeks/year = 1,250-1,500 appointments
   - Average ticket: $75 (mix of fills $65-75, services $50-150)
   - Annual revenue per technician: $93,750-112,500
   - Cost per technician (salary + benefits + commission): $40,000-50,000
   - Profit per technician: $43,750-72,500

### Step 5: Multi-Location Systemization
**Scaling from 1 to 3-5 locations requires systemization:**

**Systems to Build:**
1. **Booking System:** Online scheduling, SMS reminders, waitlist management
2. **Marketing Playbook:** Local SEO, Google Ads, Instagram (location-specific)
3. **Staffing Playbook:** Hiring profile, interview process, onboarding
4. **Operations Manual:** Opening procedure, client intake, cleaning, closing
5. **Reporting Dashboard:** Revenue per location, client count, churn, NPS

### Step 6: Activate Adjacent Revenue Streams
**Option A: Subscription Model**
- Monthly lash subscription ($99-150/month)
- Includes 2-3 fills per month + discount on additional services
- Smooths cash flow and improves churn prediction

**Option B: Product Sales**
- Lash care products (lash cleanser, seal, growth serum)
- 40%+ margin on retail
- $10-20 per client per month (sells to 20-30% of client base)
- Potential $200K+ annual revenue at 3 locations

**Option C: Franchise Model**
- Once systems are proven (3+ successful locations), franchise
- Franchise fee + ongoing royalty (4-6% of revenue)
- Leverage owner-operators to scale without capital burden

### Step 7: Location Expansion Strategy
**Phase 1 (Current):** Perfect 1-2 locations; document all systems
**Phase 2 (6 months):** Open location #3 with proven playbook
**Phase 3 (12 months):** Evaluate franchise model vs. corporate expansion
**Phase 4 (24 months):** 5-10 locations + potential franchise sales

**Economics of Expansion:**
- New location startup: $50-100K (build-out, inventory, initial marketing)
- Breakeven: 12-18 months at full utilization
- Mature location: $200-300K annual profit after all costs

## Growth Physics Formula Applications

### Formula 1: Technician Capacity Model
```
Revenue per Technician: (Appointments/Year) × (Average Ticket)
= (1,500 appointments) × ($75 average) = $112,500
Labor Cost per Technician: $45,000 (salary + commission + benefits)
Profit per Technician: $67,500 (60% margin)
```

### Formula 2: Churn Impact on LTV
```
Annual Client LTV = (Gross Profit per Client) / (Annual Churn Rate)
Assuming: $1,200 gross profit per client, 10% annual churn
LTV = $1,200 / 0.10 = $12,000
If churn drops to 5%: LTV = $1,200 / 0.05 = $24,000
→ Reducing churn 5% = doubles LTV
```

### Formula 3: Location Economics
```
Revenue per Location (at 5 technicians): $562,500
Gross Margin (60%): $337,500
Rent + Utilities + Overhead: $60,000 (annual)
Labor Cost (technicians + management): $275,000
Net Profit per Location: $2,500 / month ($30K annually)
```
