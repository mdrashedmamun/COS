## Growth Physics Analysis

### Primary Constraint
**Lead Volume** - Not unit economics.

The business has healthy economics (42% margin, 16.7:1 LTV:CAC) but conversion bottleneck: 1,800 clicks = 8 sales (0.44% conversion).

### Secondary Constraint
**Lead Magnet Effectiveness** - Current opt-in rate below 10%.

---

## The Intervention (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Diagnose Economics
✓ **Status:** Healthy
- LTV:CAC ratio of 16.7:1 is excellent (healthy = 3:1+)
- Net margin of 42% supports scaling demand
- Churn of 2.5% is exceptional
- **Decision:** Scale demand, don't fix supply

### Step 2: Define Avatar + Trigger
**Primary Avatar:** High-income professionals (age 25-45) experiencing identity-status gap
- Trigger moments: New job, promotion, divorce, major life event
- Mindset: "My image doesn't match my career/status"

**Avatar Metrics:**
- Initial LTV after onboarding: $10,000 annually
- Repeat rate: 97.5% (opposite of churn)
- Referral potential: High (personal service category)

### Step 3: Build Exceptional Lead Magnet
**Goal:** Achieve 30%+ opt-in rate (current: <10%)

**Lead Magnet Framework (Risk-Free, Easy, Fast):**
1. **Offer:** "Style Gap Assessment" - 10-minute interactive quiz
   - Questions about current style, desired image, trigger moments
   - Outputs personalized style profile
   - Risk-free: zero commitment, no personal data
   - Fast: 10 minutes max
   - Easy: mobile-optimized quiz interface

2. **Value Promise:** "Discover if your image is costing you opportunities"

3. **Conversion Path:**
   - Quiz completion → personalized profile → booking call
   - Call value prop: "Custom styling strategy session ($8,500 value)"
   - High-intent follow-up (calendar link embedded in quiz results)

### Step 4: Restructure Ad Campaign
**Current Issue:** 1,800 clicks but only 8 sales (click-to-sale conversion broken)

**New Flow:**
- Ad → Lead Magnet Quiz (target 30% opt-in from clicks)
- Quiz → Warm Email Sequence (3-email nurture about style triggers)
- Email → Calendar Call (direct booking offer)
- Call → Close ($8,500 onboarding)

**Expected Flow:**
- 1,000 clicks → 300 quiz completions → 75 calls → ~38-50 sales (50%+ show/close rate)

### Step 5: Source Audit & Channel Doubling Down
**Action:** Identify which channels drive lowest CAC with highest-quality leads
- Google Ads by intent keyword (e.g., "personal stylist," "wardrobe refresh")
- Instagram targeting high-income women in career/lifestyle niches
- Facebook lookalike audiences from best customers

**Allocate 80% of spend to top 2 channels**

### Step 6: Preserve & Optimize Retention
**Current:** 40 clients, 2.5% annual churn = excellent
- Implement quarterly touch-point (client appreciation event, style update workshop)
- Build referral incentive (give $500 credit for successful referral)
- Upsell seasonal packages (spring wardrobe, event dressing, etc.)

## Growth Physics Formula Applications

### Formula 1: Unit Economics Constraint Check
```
Healthy LTV:CAC ≥ 3:1
AC Styles: 16.7:1 ✓ PASS
→ Constraint is demand, not supply
```

### Formula 2: Churn Impact on LTV
```
True LTV = (Gross Profit per Month) / (Monthly Churn Rate)
AC Styles: (2,083 / 0.21%) = $991,667 lifetime potential
→ Protecting 2.5% churn is critical; retention = growth
```

### Formula 3: Lead Volume Target
```
Revenue Goal / Average LTV = Leads Needed Per Year
$500K annual goal / $10K LTV = 50 new clients per year = 4-5 per month
Current: ~3 per month → Need 40-50% lead volume increase
```
