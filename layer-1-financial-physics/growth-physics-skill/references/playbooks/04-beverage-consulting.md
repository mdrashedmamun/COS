# Beverage & Hospitality Consulting - Growth Physics Playbook

**Case Study:** Unfiltered Hospitality
**Revenue:** $1.1M | **Net Margin:** 11.3% | **Model:** Project-based consulting

---

## Business Model

Bar and beverage consulting service helping hospitality venues optimize operations:
- **Services:** Menu design, operational optimization, staff training, venue consulting
- **Pricing:** Project-based ($10-50K per project), retainers (emerging)
- **Revenue Model:** Currently project-based (single transaction per client)
- **Opportunity:** Shift to recurring retainer model

**Current State:** $1.1M revenue, 11.3% net margin (typical for consulting services)

---

## Growth Physics Analysis

### Primary Constraint
**Delivery Leverage** - Consulting service requires high personal time per project.

Consulting often trades time-for-money. Revenue is capped by number of projects one person/team can deliver per year. Scaling requires either team expansion or productization.

### Secondary Constraint
**Recurring Revenue Model** - Most revenue is one-off project fees.

Each project ends; no recurring revenue stream. This makes cash flow lumpy and customer lifetime value limited.

---

## The Intervention (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Diagnose Current Model
**Current Constraint:** Delivery time per project

**Typical Project Economics (Estimate):**
- Project fee: $25,000 (average)
- Implementation time: 200-300 hours
- Internal cost (salary + overhead): $75-100/hour = $15,000-30,000
- Profit per project: $0-10,000 (0-40% margin)
- Time commitment: 6-8 weeks

**Capacity:** 4-5 projects per year = 1 person at 2000 hour/year utilization
- 4 projects × $25K = $100K revenue per person
- Profit per person: $15-30K
- **With team of 3:** $300-400K revenue, $150K profit (higher margin possible)

**Current Reality:** $1.1M revenue suggests multiple team members or mix of project sizes

### Step 2: Map Consulting Value Delivery
**Problem:** Most value delivered in first 4 weeks; implementation extends 4+ more weeks

**Opportunity:** Separate value discovery from implementation

**Phase 1 (Diagnostic) - High-Margin Phase:**
- Initial assessment: 2-3 days onsite
- Deliverable: Audit report + 10-15 recommendations
- Time: 40-60 hours
- Fee: $8,000-12,000 (leverage model - audits scale)
- Margin: 70%+

**Phase 2 (Implementation) - Lower-Margin Phase:**
- Training, menu design, system setup: 6-8 weeks
- Deliverable: Implemented changes, trained staff
- Time: 200+ hours
- Fee: $15,000-20,000
- Margin: 30-40%

### Step 3: Productize the Audit Phase
**Goal:** Separate audit (can scale) from implementation (lower margin)

**Audit-as-Product:**
1. **Standardized Audit Format:**
   - Menu audit (pricing, mix, margins)
   - Operational audit (workflow, waste, efficiency)
   - Staff audit (training, turnover, productivity)
   - Financial audit (P&L analysis, benchmarking)

2. **Audit Deliverable:**
   - 20-30 page branded report
   - 3-4 core recommendations ranked by ROI
   - 90-day implementation roadmap
   - Price: $10,000 (fixed, scope-controlled)

3. **Scale Model:**
   - Remote delivery component (interviews, online assessment tools)
   - Light onsite: 2 days vs 3+ days
   - Faster turnaround: 2-3 weeks vs 4-5 weeks
   - Capacity: 10-12 audits per year per consultant

**Financial Impact:**
- Audit fee: $10,000
- Time: 60 hours
- Cost: $3,000-4,500
- Profit: $5,500-7,000 (70% margin)
- Annual per consultant: 10 audits = $55,000-70,000 profit

### Step 4: Build Retainer Model (Recurring Revenue)
**Problem:** Client relationships end after implementation

**Solution:** Post-implementation retainer

**Retainer Structure:**
- **Quarterly Check-in:** 1 day onsite quarterly
- **Services Included:**
  - Financial analysis + benchmarking
  - Menu updates and optimization
  - Staff training refresher
  - Recommendations on new trends
- **Pricing:** $3,000-5,000/quarter ($12-20K annually)
- **Margin:** 70%+ (limited onsite time, scale through systems)

**Retainer Economics:**
- Time per client: 4 days/year + email/call support
- Revenue per client: $15,000/year
- Cost per client: $2,000-3,000/year
- Profit per client: $12,000-13,000 (80%+ margin)
- Capacity: 8-10 retainer clients per consultant = $96-130K profit

**Revenue Mix Target:**
- Audits (new clients): 8 per year @ $10K = $80K
- Implementations (audit leads): 4 per year @ $20K = $80K
- Retainers (implementation leads): 8 clients @ $15K = $120K
- **Total per consultant:** $280K revenue, $140K+ profit (50%+ margin)

### Step 5: Close Audit-to-Implementation Loop
**Current Challenge:** Audit might not lead to implementation project

**Solution:** Tiered Implementation Model**
1. **Full Implementation** ($20-30K, 8-10 weeks) - for committed clients
2. **Guided Implementation** ($5-10K, 4-6 weeks) - client does work with your support
3. **Training Program** ($3-5K, 1-2 weeks) - staff training on recommendations
4. **Retainer Option** - skip implementation, go straight to quarterly retainer

**Goal:** 60%+ of audits convert to some post-audit revenue stream

### Step 6: Build Systems & Documentation
**To Scale Beyond Founder:**

1. **Audit Template & Checklist**
   - Standardized questions and metrics
   - Digital assessment tool (Google Form + custom dashboard)
   - Report generation (automated from data collection)

2. **Implementation Playbook**
   - Step-by-step guide for each recommendation type
   - Training materials (video, slides, handouts)
   - Menu design templates
   - Staff training materials

3. **Retainer Operating Procedures**
   - Quarterly analysis dashboard
   - Recommendation prioritization framework
   - Client communication template

### Step 7: Expand Service Offerings
**Once core model scales, add adjacencies:**

**Option A: Revenue Management Consulting**
- Menu engineering (pricing strategy, mix optimization)
- Yield management for high-demand periods
- Potential fee: $15-25K projects

**Option B: Technology Implementation**
- POS system selection and setup
- Inventory management software
- Staff scheduling optimization
- Potential fee: $8-12K projects

**Option C: Training Certification Program**
- Certify hospitality professionals on your methodology
- Licensing fee per location, recurring revenue
- Potential: $50-100K+ annual recurring from program

## Growth Physics Formula Applications

### Formula 1: Consulting Leverage Model
```
High-Leverage Work (Audit):
Revenue: $10,000 | Time: 60 hours | Cost: $4,000 | Profit: $6,000 (60% margin)

Lower-Leverage Work (Implementation):
Revenue: $20,000 | Time: 200 hours | Cost: $10,000 | Profit: $10,000 (50% margin)

Optimal Mix: 50% audit time, 25% implementation, 25% retainer
→ Blended margin: 60%+
```

### Formula 2: Retainer Leverage
```
Retainer Setup:
Initial Implementation: 200 hours @ $100/hr cost = $20K cost, $25K revenue
Ongoing Retainer: 40 hours/year @ $100/hr cost = $4K cost, $15K revenue
Year 1: $5K profit
Year 2-5: $11K annual profit
5-year LTV: $49K per retainer client
LTV:CAC (acquisition cost): If acquisition cost is $5K per audit = 9.8:1
```

### Formula 3: Team Scaling
```
Per Consultant Economics:
Audits: 10 @ $7K profit each = $70K
Implementations: 4 @ $10K profit each = $40K
Retainers: 8 @ $11K profit each = $88K
Total: $198K profit per consultant per year

With team of 3 consultants: $594K profit potential
Plus overhead: $594K - $200K overhead = $394K net profit
```
