# Restaurant & Food Service - Growth Physics Playbook

**Case Study:** Basil & Co Thai Restaurant
**Revenue:** $3.5M | **Net Margin:** 19% | **Model:** Multi-channel food service

---

## Business Model

Full-service Thai restaurant operating multiple revenue channels:
- **Dine-In:** Primary channel, higher margins (typically 35-40% food margin)
- **Takeout:** Secondary, lower margin but growing
- **Delivery:** Third-party commission (10-15% cut), lowest margin
- **Potential:** Catering, corporate meals, ghost kitchen

**Current State:** $3.5M revenue, 19% net margin (typical for restaurants)

---

## Growth Physics Analysis

### Primary Constraint
**Channel Mix Efficiency** - Not volume of operations.

Restaurant margins are naturally thin (18-22% typical). Opportunity lies in shifting revenue mix toward higher-margin channels rather than just growing volume.

### Secondary Constraint
**Operational Leverage** - Labor costs creep as percentage of revenue without systems.

## The Intervention (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Diagnose Margin Structure
**Goal:** Understand where money is actually made

**Channel Profitability Analysis:**
1. **Dine-In:** 40% food margin, overhead allocated = 25-30% net margin
   - Higher check average, tips don't show in food margin
   - Ambiance, drinks, desserts add incremental margin
   - **Decision:** Protect and optimize dine-in experience

2. **Takeout:** 35% food margin, no tip pressure = 18-22% net margin
   - Lower overhead (fewer staff per transaction)
   - Growing channel, but competes with dine-in for kitchen time
   - **Decision:** Grow only if capacity permits

3. **Delivery:** 35% food margin, minus 12% commission = 23% gross margin, ~5-8% net
   - Terrible margin when all delivery cost factored in
   - **Decision:** Minimize or use for customer acquisition only

### Step 2: Map Current Revenue Mix
**Hypothetical Current Mix (estimate):**
- Dine-In: 50% of revenue ($1.75M) @ 27% margin = $472K profit
- Takeout: 35% of revenue ($1.23M) @ 20% margin = $246K profit
- Delivery: 15% of revenue ($525K) @ 8% margin = $42K profit
- **Total:** $760K profit ÷ $3.5M = 21.7% margin

### Step 3: Restructure Channel Priority
**New Mix Target (12 months):**
- Dine-In: 55% of revenue ($1.93M) @ 27% margin = $521K profit
- Takeout: 25% of revenue ($875K) @ 20% margin = $175K profit
- Catering/Corporate: 15% of revenue ($525K) @ 35% margin = $184K profit
- Delivery: 5% of revenue ($175K) @ 8% margin = $14K profit
- **New Total:** $894K profit ÷ $3.5M = 25.5% margin (+6.5 points)

### Step 4: Activate High-Margin Channels
**Channel A: Catering & Corporate Meals (HIGH MARGIN)**
- Target: Corporate offices, events, wedding rehearsals
- Pricing: Minimum 30-50 person orders at 30%+ food margin + delivery fee
- Delivery: Company vehicle (not 3rd-party commission)
- CAC: Business networking, corporate partnerships, referrals
- LTV: Single large order often $1,500-3,000; repeat quarterly

**Action Items:**
1. Create catering menu (5-7 signature packages)
2. Design packaging for catering delivery (branded, premium)
3. Build corporate sales process (phone call + proposal)
4. Partner with event planners (15% referral fee structure)
5. Target: $500-750K annual catering revenue

**Channel B: Dine-In Experience Optimization (PROTECT)**
- Upsell: Premium appetizers, wine/beer, desserts
- Retention: Loyalty program (10th meal free or 10% off)
- Booking: Online reservations + 2-top table presets
- Target: Increase average check 10% through upsells
- Financial impact: $1.75M × 10% increase = +$175K revenue, +$47K profit

### Step 5: De-Prioritize Low-Margin Channels
**Delivery Channel (MINIMIZE):**
- Keep listed on apps but de-emphasize in marketing
- Don't actively promote third-party delivery
- Use only for customer acquisition (accept some loss)
- Target: Shrink to 5% of revenue from current 15%

**Takeout (MAINTAIN):**
- Support via phone/in-person orders
- Don't heavy invest in delivery app or kiosk
- Use as overflow when dine-in is full
- Target: Hold at 25% of revenue

### Step 6: Build Operational Leverage
**Systemization reduces labor % as revenue grows:**

**Current:** Likely 30% of revenue in labor (estimate)
- With volume and system improvements: Target 25% of revenue in labor

**Implementation:**
1. Standardize recipes and prep procedures
2. Implement inventory system (reduce food waste)
3. Train kitchen to prep components (mise en place)
4. Cross-train staff (reduce silos and scheduling burden)
5. Digital ordering system (reduce order entry errors)

**Financial impact:** $3.5M × 5% labor reduction = $175K annual savings

### Step 7: Test New Revenue Models
**Option A: Ghost Kitchen (Delivery-Focused)**
- Low-cost second location (commissary kitchen)
- Focus on ready-made boxes, meal kits, prepared foods
- Delivered fresh daily to corporate offices
- High volume, lower per-unit margin, but volume drives profit

**Option B: Meal Subscription**
- Weekly prepared meals delivered to homes
- $400-500 per month per customer (20 meals)
- Higher margin than delivery when subscription aggregates demand
- Lower CAC through word-of-mouth

## Growth Physics Formula Applications

### Formula 1: Margin by Channel
```
Dine-In: 40% food margin - 15% overhead = 25% net
Takeout: 35% food margin - 15% overhead = 20% net
Delivery: 35% food margin - 12% commission - 8% delivery = 15% gross, ~5% net
→ Shift mix toward high-margin channels
```

### Formula 2: Catering Unit Economics
```
Order Size: 50 people × $18 per person = $900
Food Cost: $900 × 40% = $360
Gross Profit: $540 (60% margin)
Labor + Packaging: $150
Net Profit per Order: $390 (43% margin)
LTV (4 orders per year): $1,560 per customer
```

### Formula 3: Operational Leverage
```
Current: $3.5M revenue ÷ 30% labor = $1.05M labor cost
Target: $3.5M revenue ÷ 25% labor = $875K labor cost
Savings: $175K annually (5% of revenue)
```

## 90-Day Implementation Plan

**Week 1-2:** Audit current channel profitability; build catering menu
**Week 3-4:** Develop catering packaging and corporate sales collateral
**Week 5-6:** Launch corporate outreach (100 target companies)
**Week 7-8:** Implement dine-in upsell training (wine, desserts, apps)
**Week 9-10:** Launch loyalty program; optimize table turns
**Week 11-12:** Measure channel mix shift; adjust allocation

**Success Metrics:**
- Catering launches with 5-10 orders in first month
- Dine-in average check increases 8-10%
- Delivery percentage shrinks from 15% to 8%
- Overall margin improves to 22-23%

---

## Location & Multi-Unit Scaling

**Replication:** Once model is optimized, test new location with proven mix
- Catering + Dine-In focus (minimize delivery)
- Operational systems scaled
- Potential 3-5 location chain within 3-5 years

**Path:** Single location optimized → Multi-location replication → Franchise model

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk 1: Kitchen Capacity Constraint**
- Solution: Don't grow delivery; invest capacity in catering/dine-in
- Add weekend shifts if demand warrants

**Risk 2: Quality Decay with Systemization**
- Solution: Document recipes with photos; taste-test weekly
- Keep founder/head chef involved in training

**Risk 3: Corporate Catering Client Concentration**
- Solution: Target 20+ corporate clients (not just 2-3)
- Diversify event planners + corporate partnerships
