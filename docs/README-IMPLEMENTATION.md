# Consulting Operating System - Growth Physics for Service Businesses

**A practical toolkit for analyzing, optimizing, and scaling service-based businesses.**

## 🎯 Our Focus: Service Businesses

This Consulting OS is purpose-built for service business models—where revenue comes from people delivering expertise, skills, or labor rather than from product inventory.

Our framework helps you identify the specific bottleneck constraining your growth, then provides actionable strategies backed by real case studies from businesses like yours.

## 📚 Key Concepts

### Growth Physics Formulas

**Unit Economics**: The foundation of profitable scaling
```
LTV:CAC Ratio = Customer Lifetime Value / Customer Acquisition Cost
Healthy Ratio ≥ 3:1 (ideally 5:1+)
```

**Churn Impact**: How retention affects LTV
```
True LTV = Monthly Profit / Monthly Churn Rate
Reducing churn by 5% can double LTV
```

**Constraint Identification**: Where to focus efforts
```
If LTV:CAC > 3:1 and margins healthy → Constraint is DEMAND
If margins declining with volume → Constraint is EFFICIENCY
If close rates high but lead flow low → Constraint is DEMAND
If team capacity maxed but demand high → Constraint is DELIVERY
```

**Scaling Capacity**: How fast you can grow
```
Revenue = Clients × Transaction Frequency × Average Ticket Value
Increasing any variable while protecting quality drives growth
```

### Service Business Patterns

**Pattern 1: Recurring Revenue Transforms Economics**
- Hourly billing → Retainers (2-3x LTV improvement)
- Projects → Subscriptions (predictable, scalable)
- One-time → Recurring (reduces CAC payback period)

**Pattern 2: One Constraint Usually Limits Growth**
- Multi-constraint problems are rare
- Fix the primary constraint first
- Don't over-engineer around the wrong bottleneck

**Pattern 3: Unit Economics > Volume**
- Don't scale broken unit economics
- Optimize CAC and LTV before growth acceleration
- Healthy unit economics make scaling capital efficient

**Pattern 4: Quality & Consistency Enable Scaling**
- Quality problems become more visible with growth
- Build systems and standardization first
- People → Processes → Leverage
